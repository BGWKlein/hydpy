"""This module provides some abstract base classes.

There are some type checks within the HydPy framework relying on the
build in  function :func:`isinstance`.  In order to keep HydPy
"pythonic", the following abstract base classes are defined.  All
calls to :func:`isinstance` should rely these abstract base classes
instead of the respective original classes.  This helps to build e.g.
a new parameter class when one wants to avoid to inherit from
:class:`~hydpy.core.parametertools.Parameter`.

At the moment, the provided classes do not provide things like abstract
methods(should be added later).  Just use them to register new classes
that are not actual subclasses of the respective HydPy classes, but
should be handled as if they were.  See class
:class:`~hydpy.auxs.anntools.ANN` as an example.

        class and register the subclass afterwards.


        Subclass the new abstract base class `NewABC` and define some new
        concrete classes (`New1`, `New2`, `New3`) which do not inherit
        from `NewABC`:

        >>> from hydpy.core.abctools import DocABC
        >>> class NewABC(DocABC):
        ...    "A new base class."
        >>> class New1(object):
        ...     "First new class"
        >>> class New2(object):
        ...     "Second new class"
        >>> class New3(object):
        ...     "Third new class"

        The docstring `NewABC` is still the same as defined above:

        >>> print(NewABC.__doc__)
        A new base class.

        Now we register the concrete classes `New1` and `New2`:

        >>> NewABC.register(New2)
        >>> NewABC.register(New1)
        >>> NewABC.register(New2)

        Now the docstring of `NewABC` includes the information about
        the concrete classes already registered:

        >>> print(NewABC.__doc__)
        A new base class.
        <BLANKLINE>
        At the moment, the following classes are registered:
             * :class:`~hydpy.core.abctools.New2`
             * :class:`~hydpy.core.abctools.New1`

        Note that the docstring order is the registration order.
        Also note that the "accidental reregistration" of class
        `New2` does not modify the docstring.

        Now the concrete classes `New1` and `New2` are handled as
        if they were actual subclasses of `NewABC`, but class `New3`
        -- which had not been registered -- is not:

        >>> issubclass(New1, NewABC)
        True
        >>> isinstance(New1(), NewABC)
        True
        >>> issubclass(New2, NewABC)
        True
        >>> isinstance(New2(), NewABC)
        True
        >>> issubclass(New3, NewABC)

        >>> isinstance(New3(), NewABC)
