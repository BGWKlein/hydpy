""" The HydPy-GlobWat model (`globwat`) allows for the subdivision of subbasins
into zones (hydrological response units).  Some processes, e.g. interception,
are calculated seperately for each zone.  This is why some parameters (e.g.
the interception capacity :class:`~hydpy.models.globwat.globwat_control.IcMax`)
and some sequences (e.g. the actual interception storage
:class:`~hydpy.models.globwat.globwat_states.Ic`) are 1-dimensional. Each entry
represents the value of a grid zone.

#In contrasts to the original HBV96 model, the HydPy-H-Land model allows for
#arbitrary definitions of zones.  Nevertheless, the original distinction
#in accordance with four different zone types is still supported.  The
#parameter :class:`~hydpy.models.hland.hland_control.ZoneType` defines,
#which entry of e.g. :class:`~hydpy.models.hland.hland_control.IcMax` is
#related to which zone type via integer values.  Note that for zones of
#type `field` and `forest`, the same equations are applied. (Usually,
#larger :class:`~hydpy.models.hland.hland_control.IcMax` values and smaller
#:class:`~hydpy.models.hland.hland_control.CFMax` are assigned to `forest`
#zones due to their higher leaf area index and the associated decrease in
#solar radiation.) On the contrary, zones of type `glacier` and `ilake` are
#partly connected to different process equations.


For comprehensibility, this module introduces the relevant integer constants.
