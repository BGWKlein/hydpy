  abstract  = {A parameterization is developed for the calculation of evapotranspiration in three-dimensional atmospheric models. It distinguishes separately between evaporation from the ground and evapotranspiration from plant foliage. Soil water is stored in an active layer of 1 m depth and a 10 cm surface layer is separately distinguished. The evaporation from this soil is parameterized using a high resolution multilayer model for comparison. This parameterized evaporation from the soil is defined by either the potential evaporation rate or by the maximum rate at which water can diffuse to the surface, depending on which rate is smaller. The maximum rate is obtained empirically in terms of various soil-hydraulic parameters. The evapotranspiration from plants occurs either as the evaporation of water stored on the surface of the foliage or as the transpiration of water extracted by roots from the soil. The flux of water from the outer surface of foliage to the atmosphere above the canopy is determined by the decrease in water vapor concentration from the foliage surface to the overlying atmosphere and by the resistance of the foliage molecular boundary layers and the bulk aerodynamic resistance of the canopy. Transpired water encounters an additional stomatal resistance in passing from the inside to the outside of leaves. The foliage temperature and saturation vapor pressure are calculated from a model of the plant canopy energy balance. Soil moisture determines the maximum rate at which roots can extract water from the soil, and if the transpiration demand exceeds this maximum rate, stomatal closure occurs until the demand matches the root supply. A parameterization of land evapotranspiration at the level of detail described in this paper may be required to obtain a realistic diurnal cycle of surface temperature and evapotranspiration for use in mesoscale or global climate models. However, application of the developed procedures is made difficult by the extreme complexity and small-scale detail of surface processes, the lack of adequate data sets for surface parameters, and the need for satisfactory parameterizations of other components of. GCMs such as their rainfall and planetary boundary layer treatments. Because of these difficulties, the development of validated models of land surface processes first requires detailed sensitivity studies to establish what further data sets are most urgently required and what model improvement should be given highest priority.},

  abstract = {Measurements of evaporation from barley using a neutron moisture meter are compared with estimates from the Penman formula. Values of aerodynamic resistance (ra) in 1971 are calculated from profile measurements of wind and temperature and empirical relationships are derived between ra, crop height and wind speed. The surface diffusive resistance (rs) is calculated throughout the 1971 season (using the generalised Penman formula derived by Monteith, 1965) from measurements of net radiation, soil heat flux, temperature, vapour pressure (ra, assumed to be equal to the resistance to transfer of water vapour) and evaporation either obtained by the Bowen ratio method or from a weighing lysimeter. A relationship is then derived between rs and leaf area index and a function of soil moisture deficit. The same formula is used in conjunction with the empirical values of ra and rs to derive estimates of evaporation in 1970. These show good agreement with the measured values. The aim is to obtain results of practical use and the empirical relationships are therefore kept as simple as possible, using only easily measured or estimated quantities.},

The objectives were to improve its potential for making use of spatially distributed data, to make it more physically sound and to improve the model performance. The new version, HBV-96, uses subbasin division with a typical resolution of 40 km z, although any resolution can be used. In addition, each subbasin is divided into elevation bands, vegetation and snow classes. Automatic weighting of precipitation and temperature stations was introduced and a new automatic calibration scheme was developed. The modifications led to significant improvements in model performance. In seven test basins the average value of the efficiency criterion R2 increased from 86 to 89%, with improvements in both the calibration and verification periods.},

  abstract = {Runoff conditions are strongly controlled by climate. Therefore, any uncertainties in the projections about future climate directly translate to uncertainties in future runoff. If several climate models are applied with the same emission scenario, there may be large differences in the climate projections due to model related biases and natural climate variability. To address this issue, an ensemble modelling approach – which considers a set of climate models – is applied in this study with a monthly, conceptual hydrological model for assessing future runoff conditions in the upper Danube basin (101,810km2). Observed data of the past 120years of the HISTALP data-set are used to evaluate runoff simulations under historic climate variations as well as to test the delta-change method for bias correction of climate data. Uncertainties caused by the hydrological model or by the method for bias correction appear to be small. Projections about future climate are obtained from 21 regional climate models (RCMs) of the ENSEMBLES project for the A1B emission scenario. Evaluation and ranking of the RCMs reveals that some of the models have considerable biases in simulation of spatio-temporal patterns of historic precipitation and temperature. There is however, no systematic relationship between historic performance and projected future change. Even for the better performing RCMs the differences in the simulation results are large. This is a strong argument for using an ensemble modelling approach, which yields a range of future runoff conditions instead of a deterministic projection. In general, a strong decrease of summer runoff is simulated, whereas there is no clear signal for changes in winter runoff. The spread between different RCMs in future seasonal runoff is larger than for the monthly flow duration curve. Overall, the projected changes in future runoff conditions become more pronounced towards the end of the 21st century.},
