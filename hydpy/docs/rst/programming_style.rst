Programming style
_________________

Python allows for writing concise and easily readable software code,
that can be maintained and further developed with relative ease.
However, code quality does also depend on the experience (and available
time) of the programmer writing it.  In hydrology, much model code is
written by PhD students and other young scientists, who --- besides
having participated in some more or less comprehensive introductory
courses --- have often little programming experience and who are under
the pressure not only to get their model running, but also to tackle
their scientific questions and to publish as many research articles
as possible within a limited period of time.  The source code
resulting from such a rush is understandably often a mess.  And even
the better software results often prove inadequate when it comes
to transferring the software into practical applications or sharing it
with other researchers.

This is why we defined the HydPy Style Guide, which is a refinement
of `PEP 8`_ --- the "official" Style Guide for Python Code.
`PEP 8`_ gives coding conventions that help to write clear code.
And it eases diving into already existing source code, as one has
less effort with unravelling the mysteries of overly creative
programming solutions.

In some regards, the HydPy Style Guide deviates substantially from `PEP 8`_.
This is mostly due to following two aims.  First, that the HydPy framework
shall be applicable for hydrologists with little or even no programming
experience.  Ideally, such framework users should not even notice that they
are writing valid Python code while preparing their configuration files.
Secondly, that the common gap between model code, model documentation and
model testing should be closed as well as possible.  Understanding the
model documentation of a certain HydPy version should be identical with
understanding how the model actually works under the same HydPy version.
These two points are elucidated in the following subsections.


Framework features
------------------
When trying to contribute code to the core tools of HydPy (meaning
basically everything except the actual model implementations), on has
to be aware that even slight changes can have significant effects
on the applicability of HydPy, and that future HydPy developers must
cope with your contributions.   So, always make sure to check the effects
of your code changes properly (as described below).  And try to structure
your code in a readable, object-oriented design.  This section describes
some conventions for the development of HydPy, but is no guidance on how
to write good source code in general.  So, if you have little experience
in programming, first make sure to learn the basics of Python through some
`Python tutorials`_.  Afterwards, improve your knowledge of code quality
through reading more advanced literature like this
`book on object-oriented design`_.


Imports
.......
As recommended in `PEP 8`_, clarify the sources of your imports.
Always use the following pattern at the top of a new module
(with some example packages):

    >>> # import...
    >>> # ...from standard library
    >>> import os
    >>> import sys
    >>> # ...from site-packages
    >>> import numpy
    >>> # ...from HydPy
    >>> from hydpy.core import sequencetools
    >>> from hydpy.cythons import pointerutils

Note that each import command has its own line.  Always import
complete modules from HydPy without changing their names. ---
No wildcard imports!

The wildcard ban is lifted when writing configuration files.
Using the parameter control files as an example, it wouldn't be nice to
always write something like:

    >>> from hydpy.models import hland
    >>> model = hland.Model()
    >>> from hydpy.core import parametertools
    >>> model.parameters = parametertools.Parameters({'model':model})
    >>> model.parameters.control = hland.ControlParameters(model.parameters.control)
    >>> model.parameters.control.nmbzones = 2
    >>> model.parameters.control.nmbzones
    nmbzones(2)

Here a wildcard import (and some magic, see below), allows for a much
cleaner syntax:

    >>>  # First delete the model instance of the example above.
    >>> del model
    >>> # Now repeat the above example in a more intuitive manner.
    >>> from hydpy.models.hland import *
    >>> parameterstep('1d')
    >>> nmbzones(2)
    >>> nmbzones
    nmbzones(2)

Note that the wildcard import is acceptable here, as there is only one
import statement.  There is no danger of name conflicts.

Defensive Programming
.....................
HydPy is intended to be applicable by researchers and practitioners
who are no Python experts and may have little experience in programming
in general.  Hence it is desirable to anticipate errors due to misleading
input as good as possible and report them as soon as possible.
So, in contradiction to `PEP 8`_, it is recommended to not just expose
the names of simple public attributes.  Instead, use protected attributes
(usually properties) to assure that the internal states of objects remain
consistent, whenever this appears to be useful. One example is that it
is not allowed to assign an unknown string to the `outputfiletype` of a
|SequenceManager|:

    >>> from hydpy.core.filetools import SequenceManager
    >>> sm = SequenceManager()
    >>> sm.fluxfiletype = 'test'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ValueError: The given sequence file type `test` is not implemented.  Please choose one of the following file types: npy, asc, and nc.

Of course, the extensive usage of protected attributes increases
the length of the source code and slows computation time.  But,
regarding the first point, writing a graphical user interface
would require much more source code.  And, regarding the second
point, the computation times of the general framework
functionalities discussed here should be negligible in comparison
with the computation times of the hydrological simulations,
which are discussed below, in the majority of cases.

Exceptions
..........
Unmodified error messages of Python (and of the imported
libraries) are often not helpful in the application of HydPy due
to two reasons: First, they are probably read by someone who has
no experience in understanding Pythons exception handling system.
And secondly, they do not tell in which context a problem occurs.
Here, "context" does not mean the relevant part of the source code,
which is of course referenced in the traceback; instead, it means
things like the concerned geographical location.  It would, for example,
be of little help to only know that the required value of a certain
parameter is not available when the same parameter is applied
thousands of times in different subcatchments.  Try to add as much
helpful information to error messages as possible, e.g.::

    raise RuntimeError('For parameter %s of element %s no value has been '
                       'defined so far.  Hence it is not possible to...'
                       % (parameter.name, objecttools.devicename(parameter)))

(The function |devicename| tries to determine the name of the |Node|
or |Element| instance (indirectly) containing the given object, which
is in many cases the most relevant information for identifying the
error source.)

Whenever possible, us function |augment_excmessage| to augment
standard Python error messages with `HydPy information`.


Naming Conventions
..................
The naming conventions of `PEP 8`_ apply.  Additionally, it is
encouraged to name classes and their instances as similar as
possible whenever reasonable, often simply switching from
**CamelCase** to **lowercase**. This can be illustrated based
on some classes for handling time series:

=============== ============== ===================================================================================
Class Name      Instance Name  Note
=============== ============== ===================================================================================
Sequences       sequences      each Model instance handles exactly one Sequence instance: `model.sequences`
InputSequences  inputs         "inputsequences" would be redundant for attribute access: `model.sequences.inputs`
=============== ============== ===================================================================================

If possible, each instance should define its own preferred name via
the property `name`:

    >>> from hydpy.models.hland import *
    >>> InputSequences(None).name
    'inputs'

For classes like |Element| or |Node|, where names (and not
namespaces) are used to differentiate between instances, the
property `name` is also implemented, but --- of course --- not
related to the class name, e.g.:

    >>> from hydpy import Node
    >>> Node('gauge1').name
    'gauge1'

In HydPy, instances of the same or similar type should be grouped in
collection objects with a similar name, but with an attached letter "s".
Different |Element| instances are storedin an instance of the class
|Elements|, different |Node| instances are stored in an instance of
the class |Nodes|...

Collection Classes
..................
The naming (of the instances) of collection classes is discussed just
above.  Additionally, try to follow the following recommendations.

Each collection object should be iterable, e.g.:

    >>> from hydpy import Nodes
    >>> nodes = Nodes('gauge1', 'gauge2')
    >>> for node in nodes:
    ...     node
    Node("gauge1", variable="Q")
    Node("gauge2", variable="Q")

To ease working in the interactive mode, objects handled by a
collection object should be accessible as attributes:

    >>> nodes.gauge1
    Node("gauge1", variable="Q")
    >>> nodes.gauge2
    Node("gauge2", variable="Q")

Whenever usefull, define convenience functions which simplify the
handling of collection objects, e.g.:

    >>> nodes += Node('gauge1')
    >>> nodes.gauge1 is Node('gauge1')
    True
    >>> len(nodes)
    2
    >>> 'gauge1' in nodes
    True
    >>> nodes.gauge1 in nodes
    True
    >>> newnodes = nodes.copy()
    >>> nodes is newnodes
    False
    >>> nodes.gauge1 is newnodes.gauge1
    True
    >>> nodes -= 'gauge1'
    >>> 'gauge1' in nodes
    False


String Representations
......................
Be aware of the difference between |str| and |repr|.  A good string
representation (return value of |repr|) is one
that a Non-Python-Programmer does not identify to be a string.
The first ideal case is that copy-pasting the string representation
within a command line to evaluate it returns a reference to the same
object. A Python example:

    >>> repr(None)
    'None'
    >>> eval('None') is None
    True

A HydPy example:

    >>> from hydpy import Node
    >>> Node('gauge1')
    Node("gauge1", variable="Q")
    >>> eval('Node("gauge1", variable="Q")') is Node('gauge1')
    True

In the second ideal case is that evaluating the string representation
results in an equal object. A Python example:

    >>> 1.5
    1.5
    >>> eval('1.5') is 1.5
    False
    >>> eval('1.5') == 1.5
    True

A HydPy example:

    >>> from hydpy import Period
    >>> Period('1d')
    Period('1d')
    >>> eval("Period('1d')") is Period('1d')
    False
    >>> eval("Period('1d')") == Period('1d')
    True

For nested objects this might be more hard to accomplish, but sometimes it's
worth it.  A Python example:

    >>> [1., 'a']
    [1.0, 'a']
    >>> eval("[1.0, 'a']") == [1.0, 'a']
    True

A HydPy example:

    >>> from hydpy import Timegrid
    >>> Timegrid('01.11.1996', '1.11.2006', '1d')
    Timegrid('01.11.1996 00:00:00',
             '01.11.2006 00:00:00',
             '1d')
    >>> eval("Timegrid('01.11.1996 00:00:00', '01.11.2006 00:00:00', '1d')") == Timegrid('01.11.1996', '1.11.2006', '1d')
    True

ToDo: For deeply nested objects, this strategy becomes infeasible, of course.
SubParameters(None)...

Sometimes, additional information might increase the value of a
string representation.  Add comments in these cases, but only when
the |Options.reprcomments| flag handled in module |pub| is activated:

    >>> from hydpy.models.hland import *
    >>> parameterstep('1d')
    >>> nmbzones(2)
    >>> from hydpy.pub import options
    >>> options.reprcomments = True
    >>> nmbzones
    # Number of zones (hydrological response units) in a subbasin [-].
    nmbzones(2)
    >>> options.reprcomments = False
    >>> nmbzones
    nmbzones(2)

Such comments are of great importance, whenever the string representation
might be misleading:

    >>> simulationstep('12h')
    >>> percmax(2)
    >>> options.reprcomments = True
    >>> percmax
    # Maximum percolation rate [mm/T].
    # The actual value representation depends on the actual parameter step size,
    # which is `1d`.
    percmax(2.0)
    >>> options.reprcomments = False
    >>> percmax
    percmax(2.0)


Introspection
.............

One of Pythons major strengths is `introspection`, allowing you to analyze
(and modify) objects fundamentally at runtime.  One simple example would
be to access and change the documentation of a single HBV `number of zones`
parameter initialized at runtime.  Here, the given string representation
comment is simply the first line of the documentation string of class
|hland_control.NmbZones|:

    >>> from hydpy.models.hland.hland_control import NmbZones
    >>> NmbZones.__doc__.split('\n')[0]
    'Number of zones (hydrological response units) in a subbasin [-].'

However, we could define a unique documentation string for the specific
|hland_control.NmbZones| instance defined above:

    >>> nmbzones.__doc__ = NmbZones.__doc__.replace('a subbasin',
    ...                                             'the amazonas basin')

Now the representation string (only) of this instance is changed:

    >>> options.reprcomments = True
    >>> nmbzones
    # Number of zones (hydrological response units) in the amazonas basin [-].
    nmbzones(2)

As you can see, it is easy to retrieve information from living objects
and to adjust them to specific situations.  With little effort, one
can do much more tricky things. But when writing production code, one
has to be cautious.  First, do not all Python implementations support
each introspection feature of CPython.  Secondly is introspection often
a possible source of confusion.  For HydPy, only the second issue is of
importance, as the use of Cython rules out its application on alternative
Python implementations as `PyPy`_.  But the second issue needs to be
taken into account more strongly.

HydPy makes extensive use of Pythons introspection features, whenever it
serves the purpose of relieving non-programmers from writing code lines
that do not deal with hydrological modelling directly.  Section `Imports`_
discusses the usage of wildcard imports in parameter control files.
However, the real comfort comes primarily from the `magic` implemented
in the function |parameterstep|.  Through calling this function one does
not only define a relevant time interval length for the following parameter
values.  One also initializes a new model instance (if such an instance
does not already exist) and makes its control parameter objects available
in the local namespace.  Hence, for the sake of the user's comfort, each
parameter control file purports being a simple configuration file that
somehow checks its own validity.  On the downside, to modify the operating
principle of HydPy's parameter control files requires more thought than if
everything would have been accomplished in a more direct manner.

It is encouraged to implement additional introspection features into
HydPy, as long as they improve the intuitive usability for non-programmers.
But one should be particularly cautious when doing so and document the
why and how thoroughly.  To ensure traceability, one should usually add
such code to the modules like |modelutils| and |autodoctools|.  Module
|modelutils| deals with all introspection needed to `cythonize` Python models
automatically.  Module |autodoctools| serves for improving HydPy's online
documentation automatically.
