Whenever reasonable, import only packages of
`The Python Standard Library`_ or at least restrict yourself
to mature and stable site-packages.  At the moment, HydPy relies
only on the highly accepted site-packages `Cython`_, `NumPy`_,
and `matplotlib`_.  Further developments of HydPy based on more
specialized site-packages (e.g. for plotting maps) might be
useful.  But the related import commands should be secured in
a way that allows for the application of HydPy without having
these specialized site-packages available.
