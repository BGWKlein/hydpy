Core Modules
============

The core subpackage of :ref:`HydPy` essentially defines how models can
and should be programmed, documented and applied.  As can be seen in
the side-bar, the list of modules contained in the core subpackage
is quite large.  The following paragraphs try to give some hints to
novices, which basic aspects of using :ref:`HydPy` are related with
which module.

Module :ref:`hydpytools` provides the :class:`~hydpy.core.hydpytools.HydPy`
class.  The main purpose of this class is to help users accomplish possibly
complex things via a simple interface.  Very often, you will only need
to initialize an :class:`~hydpy.core.hydpytools.HydPy` object and to
call its methods in order to e.g. load all input data, perform a simulation
run, and to store the relevant results.  So trying to get an overview of
the methods of class :class:`~hydpy.core.hydpytools.HydPy` is generally a
good idea.

The documentation on module :ref:`filetools` describes the standard
directory structure of :ref:`HydPy` projects.  Module :ref:`filetools`
offers some flexibility in adjusting this project structure to your
needs.  Also, it is responsible for many aspects of loading data from
files and storing data to files.

:ref:`HydPy` represents the network of a river basin via connected
objects of the classes :class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Node` and
:class:`~hydpy.core.devicetools.Element`.  These are defined in module
:mod:`~hydpy.core.devicetools`. It is often helpful to define subsets
of networks, which is provided by module :mod:`~hydpy.core.selectiontools`.
In this context, reading the documentation on module
:mod:`~hydpy.auxs.networktools` could also be of interest, as it
implements strategies to define :ref:`HydPy` networks in large basins.

The actual data to run a certain model is handled in `control files`
(containing parameter values), `condition files` (containing state
conditions) and `sequence files` (containing input or output time
series).  Modules :mod:`~hydpy.core.parametertools` and
:mod:`~hydpy.core.sequencetools` provide features to handle these
different kinds of data.

Module :mod:`~hydpy.core.timetools` provides the
:class:`~hydpy.core.timetools.Timegrids` class, of which an object
needs to be stored in the "global information" module :mod:`~hydpy.pub`.
Use this :class:`~hydpy.core.timetools.Timegrids` object to define
the time period for  which data shall be initialized and the time period
for which one simulation (or multiple simulations) shall be performed.

The other modules serve more special purposes.  If you are thinking
about adding new code to :ref:`HydPy` or changing existing one, you
should read the documentation of some other modules as well.
:mod:`~hydpy.core.autodoctools` provides features for automatically
generating this online documentation.  Modules :mod:`~hydpy.core.testtools`
and :mod:`~hydpy.core.dummytools` provide features for testing new  code
(or old code, that has not been covered by the existing tests so far).
Module :ref:`objecttools` (need to be refactored) provides very
different kinds of features to simplify and standardize writing
:ref:`HydPy` code.
